properties describe a building record:
○ Address (city, street, number)
○ Owner
○ Size (square meters)
○ Market value
○ Property type (apartment, house, industrial etc.)
● An endpoint that calculates the total yearly real estate tax (market value times tax rate) for
all properties owned by a particular owner.
